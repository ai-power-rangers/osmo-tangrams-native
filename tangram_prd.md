üß© TECHNICAL PRD ‚Äî Tangram Game (SwiftUI + SpriteKit)
üéØ GOAL
Build a 2D interactive tangram puzzle game where kids can drag, rotate, and place tangram pieces into puzzle outlines. Built using SpriteKit (for game interaction) and SwiftUI (for UI, menus, etc).

[ SwiftUI App ]
    |
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Menu / Level Select View (SwiftUI)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TangramGameView (SwiftUI)
             ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Embedded SpriteKit Scene (TangramGameScene.swift)
SwiftUI: Handles navigation, menus, and UI overlays

SpriteKit: Handles drag, drop, rotation, snapping, win detection

üß± CORE COMPONENTS
1. TangramGameView.swift (SwiftUI)
A SwiftUI wrapper view with a SpriteView embedded

Passes level config to the scene

Displays win state UI when puzzle is solved

swift
Copy
Edit
SpriteView(scene: TangramGameScene(level: selectedLevel))
    .ignoresSafeArea()
2. TangramGameScene.swift (SpriteKit)
Responsible for:

Rendering tangram pieces and target outlines

Handling dragging, rotating, and snapping

Detecting win condition

Structure:

swift
Copy
Edit
class TangramGameScene: SKScene {
    var level: TangramLevel
    var pieces: [TangramPieceNode]
    var targets: [ShapeTargetNode]

    override func didMove(to view: SKView) {
        setupLevel()
    }

    func setupLevel()
    func checkForSnap()
    func checkForWin()
}
3. TangramPieceNode.swift
Subclass of SKShapeNode or SKSpriteNode

Supports:

Dragging (touchesMoved)

Rotation (via buttons or multitouch)

Snap detection

4. ShapeTargetNode.swift
Passive nodes representing where shapes should be placed

Includes:

Position

Shape type

Rotation

5. Level Data Model
swift
Copy
Edit
struct TangramLevel {
    let id: UUID
    let targetShapes: [ShapeTarget]
    let initialPieces: [TangramPiece]
}

struct ShapeTarget {
    let type: ShapeType
    let position: CGPoint
    let rotation: CGFloat
}

struct TangramPiece {
    let type: ShapeType
    let startPosition: CGPoint
    let rotation: CGFloat
}
Store this as JSON or structs in Swift.

üñ±Ô∏è INTERACTION SPECS
Action	Behavior
Drag tangram piece	Piece follows user‚Äôs finger
Rotate piece	Rotate button or two-finger twist
Snap to target	If near correct target (within threshold), snap in
Win state	All pieces matched ‚Üí trigger success animation/alert

üì¶ SNAP DETECTION LOGIC
On drag end:

Check proximity to each ShapeTargetNode

If same type + close enough (position + rotation), snap

Else, stay where dropped

swift
Copy
Edit
let positionThreshold: CGFloat = 20
let rotationThreshold: CGFloat = 10 // degrees
üß™ PUZZLE COMPLETION LOGIC
Loop through all targets:

swift
Copy
Edit
for target in targets {
    guard let match = pieceNearby(target),
          match.type == target.type,
          isCloseEnough(position, rotation)
    else {
        return
    }
}
triggerWin()
üß© OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS

Sound effects	run(SKAction.playSoundFileNamed:)
Rotation gestures	Add rotation buttons or multitouch
Puzzle builder	UI to drag pieces ‚Üí export as JSON

üß™ DEBUGGING TOOLS
Show target outlines with low opacity

Log position + rotation deltas for each snap

A working Level JSON + parser?

SpriteKit touch handling code with snap logic?

Let me know how deep to go next.

You didn't include how to generate the tangrams in this PRD nor specify their geometric constraints relative to each other


ChatGPT said:
You're right ‚Äî I skipped over the geometric structure of the tangram set and how to programmatically generate them. These are core to both rendering and puzzle validation.

Let‚Äôs fix that.

‚ú® Tangram Geometry & Generation Addendum (for SpriteKit or SwiftUI)
üß© Tangram Set ‚Äî Standard Pieces
A classic 7-piece tangram puzzle contains:

Name	Count	Shape	Notes
Large Triangle	2	Right triangle	Hypotenuse = full square length
Medium Triangle	1	Right triangle	Half size of large triangle
Small Triangle	2	Right triangle	Half size of medium triangle
Square	1	Square	Sides = same as small triangle's legs
Parallelogram	1	Rhomboid	Same area as square, flipped

üìè Standard layout fits in a 1x1 square
Use a unit square (1x1) or scaled square (e.g. 200x200) as the canvas.

üìê Tangram Geometry: Piece Definitions
We'll define each shape in terms of unit size and point offsets.

1. Large Triangle (x2)
swift
Copy
Edit
// Points for right triangle with hypotenuse length = 1
[
    CGPoint(x: 0, y: 0),
    CGPoint(x: 1, y: 0),
    CGPoint(x: 0, y: 1)
]
Area = 0.5

Sides = 1, 1, ‚àö2

2. Medium Triangle (x1)
swift
Copy
Edit
[
    CGPoint(x: 0, y: 0),
    CGPoint(x: 0.5, y: 0),
    CGPoint(x: 0, y: 0.5)
]
3. Small Triangle (x2)
swift
Copy
Edit
[
    CGPoint(x: 0, y: 0),
    CGPoint(x: 0.5, y: 0),
    CGPoint(x: 0, y: 0.5)
]
Same as medium triangle but rotated and reused.

4. Square (x1)
swift
Copy
Edit
[
    CGPoint(x: 0, y: 0),
    CGPoint(x: 0.5, y: 0),
    CGPoint(x: 0.5, y: 0.5),
    CGPoint(x: 0, y: 0.5)
]
5. Parallelogram (x1)
swift
Copy
Edit
[
    CGPoint(x: 0, y: 0),
    CGPoint(x: 0.5, y: 0),
    CGPoint(x: 0.75, y: 0.5),
    CGPoint(x: 0.25, y: 0.5)
]
Note: this shape can‚Äôt be matched by just rotation ‚Äî it needs flipping to match mirror images.

üõ† How to Generate Tangram Shapes in Code (SpriteKit)
Here‚Äôs a generic function for creating a shape node:

swift
Copy
Edit
func createTangramPiece(points: [CGPoint], size: CGFloat, color: UIColor) -> SKShapeNode {
    let path = CGMutablePath()
    let scaledPoints = points.map { CGPoint(x: $0.x * size, y: $0.y * size) }

    path.move(to: scaledPoints[0])
    for pt in scaledPoints.dropFirst() {
        path.addLine(to: pt)
    }
    path.closeSubpath()

    let shape = SKShapeNode(path: path)
    shape.fillColor = color
    shape.strokeColor = .black
    shape.lineWidth = 1
    shape.name = "tangram_piece"
    return shape
}
You can now call:

swift
Copy
Edit
let triangle = createTangramPiece(points: [
    CGPoint(x: 0, y: 0),
    CGPoint(x: 1, y: 0),
    CGPoint(x: 0, y: 1)
], size: 100, color: .red)
üß† Geometric Constraints
To ensure pieces "fit together" when solving a puzzle:

All pieces must lie inside a shared 1x1 space

Snapping must check:

Shape type

Position delta (within Œµ pixels)

Rotation (within Œµ degrees)

Optional: Flipping detection (for parallelogram)

You may want to store reference positions and rotations in level definitions:

swift
Copy
Edit
struct ShapeTarget {
    let type: ShapeType
    let origin: CGPoint
    let rotation: CGFloat
    let flipped: Bool
}
üóÇ Level Authoring Format
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "id": "cat",
  "targets": [
    {
      "type": "largeTriangle",
      "origin": [100, 200],
      "rotation": 45
    },
    ...
  ]
}
üîÅ Reusability
Each of the 7 pieces can be reused across puzzles ‚Äî store their base geometry once, and move/rotate/flip based on each level's layout.
